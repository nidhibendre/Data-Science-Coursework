# Statistical Inference Assignment: NHANES Population Analysis

This assignment encompasses statistical inference, confidence interval estimations, and hypothesis testing applied to NHANES dataset analysis.

## Assignment Overview

### Confidence Intervals
**Objective:** Calculate confidence intervals for height, BMI, and sleep duration of individuals in the NHANES population.

**Methodology:**
- Utilize the `infer` package in R for interval estimations.
- Bootstrap methods applied for interval calculations.

**Interpretations:**
- Understand and interpret the derived confidence intervals.

### Proportion Estimation - Hard Drug Usage
**Objective:** Estimate the proportion of individuals reporting hard drug usage based on NHANES data.

**Methodology:**
- Create samples and estimate proportions.
- Employ bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals using various methods.

**Interpretations:**
- Interpret confidence intervals for hard drug usage proportions.

### Comparative Analysis - Age Groups and Drug Usage
**Objective:** Investigate the difference in drug experimentation proportions between individuals in their 20s and 50s.

**Methodology:**
- Analyze proportions across age groups using sampling and bootstrap techniques.
- Estimate and interpret differences in proportions.

### Hypothesis Testing - Oral Contraceptives and Cholesterol
**Objective:** Assess the effect of oral contraceptives on cholesterol levels among women aged 35-50.

**Methodology:**
- Conduct hypothesis testing and compute confidence intervals.
- Interpret confidence intervals for differences in average cholesterol levels.

Each section addresses a specific analysis or question within this comprehensive assignment, showcasing proficiency in statistical inference and data analysis using the NHANES dataset.
