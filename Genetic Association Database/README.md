# Genetic Association Database (GAD) Analysis

## Description
This repository contains SQL queries and analysis performed on the Genetic Association Database (GAD) as part of the CS3200 course assignment on Database Design. The SQL queries explore various aspects of the dataset, investigating genetic associations, diseases, and phenotypes.

## Contents

### SQL Queries
- `assignment1.sql`: SQL script containing queries exploring and analyzing the GAD dataset.

### Analysis Overview
- Various SQL queries were executed to:
  - Explore disease classes and their frequency.
  - Investigate genetic associations related to specific diseases or phenotypes.
  - Analyze genetic information and chromosomal attributes.
  - Identify significant genetic associations and their occurrences.
  - Interpretation and analysis of the obtained results.

### Interpretation
- Interpretation of the results obtained from the SQL queries.
- Analysis of the connections between diseases, genetic associations, and phenotypes.

### References
- External sources and citations used for interpretation and analysis.

## Usage
- The `assignment1.sql` file contains SQL queries used for the analysis.
- Clone or download the repository to replicate the queries or explore the dataset further using compatible database systems.

## Notes
- The analysis and interpretation aim to provide insights into genetic associations, diseases, and phenotypes based on the GAD dataset.
- Feel free to use or modify the SQL queries for academic or learning purposes.
