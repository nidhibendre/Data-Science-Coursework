# Heart Patients Analysis

This Python script analyzes a dataset of patients, differentiating heart disease and non-heart disease patients based on various characteristics.

## Functionality:
- **Reading Data:** Utilizes functions to read data from `heart.csv`, skipping headers, and organizing patient attributes.
- **Statistics:** Calculates the number of patients, patients with heart disease, and averages of age and resting blood pressure.
- **Visualization:** Generates a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between maximum heart rate and cholesterol, categorizing patients by heart disease presence.

## Usage:
1. **File Input:** Ensure the specified CSV file ('heart.csv') is available in the same directory.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script 'heart_explore.py'.
3. **Output:** The script generates visualizations and other exploratory factors of the data.

## Output Files Generated:
- `heart.png`: Output scatter plot generated by the script of maximum heart rate vs. cholesterol

## File Structure:
- **heart_explore.py: Python script containing code for data analysis and visualization.
- **README.md: Explanation of the script's functionality, usage instructions, and output description.
- **heart.csv: Dataset used for the analysis.
