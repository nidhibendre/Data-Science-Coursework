# Diagnostic Testing Evaluation

This file contains code and analysis for a diagnostic testing evaluation assignment focusing on statistical analysis and interpretation of diagnostic tests.

## Assignment Details

### Objective
The assignment involves exploring various statistical measures used in diagnostic testing scenarios and analyzing their implications.

### Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Packages:** Tidyverse

## Contents

### Assignment Tasks
1. Definition of terms related to diagnostic testing in both English and Probability.
2. Evaluation of diagnostic criteria for myocardial infarction (MI).
3. Analysis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease diagnosis using clinical criteria.
4. Assessment of a saliva thiocyanate (SCN) test for classifying smokers and non-smokers.
5. Evaluation of a hypothetical diagnostic test based on prevalence rates.

### Interpretation and Implications
- Analysis of the relationship between prevalence rates and positive predictive value (PPV) of diagnostic tests.
- Evaluation of extreme scenarios regarding sensitivity and specificity in diagnostic testing procedures.
- Generation and analysis of a Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve).

### Conclusions
- Examination of different testing criteria and their suitability for diagnosis based on sensitivity and specificity.

## How to Run
The code is written in R and is organized into separate sections corresponding to each task. To run the code:

1. Ensure R is installed on your system.
2. Open the R script corresponding to each task.
3. Execute the code block by block or all at once to observe the results.

## Insights and Findings
- Prevalence rates significantly impact the positive predictive value of diagnostic tests.
- Extreme scenarios of sensitivity and specificity highlight their impact on test outcomes.
- The Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve aids in determining the most suitable testing criteria.
